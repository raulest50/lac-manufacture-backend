# Security Improvements for LA Cosmetics Backend

## Overview

This document outlines the security improvements implemented in the LA Cosmetics backend application to enhance the login system and overall security posture.

## Implemented Security Measures

### 1. Password Encryption with BCrypt

- Replaced `NoOpPasswordEncoder` with `BCryptPasswordEncoder` for secure password hashing
- Added a `passwordEncoded` flag to the `User` entity to track encryption status
- Modified `UserManagementService` to encrypt passwords during user creation and updates

### 2. JWT Authentication

- Implemented JSON Web Token (JWT) based authentication
- Created `JwtTokenProvider` for token generation and validation
- Added `JwtAuthenticationFilter` to intercept and process JWT tokens in requests
- Configured stateless session management for improved security

### 3. Password Migration Strategy

- Implemented `MigrationAuthenticationProvider` to handle existing plain text passwords
- Automatic migration of plain text passwords to BCrypt-encoded passwords upon successful login
- Seamless transition for users without requiring password resets

### 4. Authentication Endpoint

- Created `/api/auth/login` endpoint for secure authentication
- Returns JWT token upon successful authentication
- Improved error handling for authentication failures

## Configuration

### JWT Properties

JWT configuration is stored in `application-jwt.properties`:

```properties
# JWT Configuration
jwt.secret=lacosmetics_secure_jwt_secret_key_for_authentication_and_authorization
jwt.expiration=86400000  # 24 hours in milliseconds
```

**Important**: In a production environment, the JWT secret should be:
- Longer and more complex
- Stored securely (e.g., environment variables, secret management service)
- Rotated periodically

## How to Use

### Authentication

To authenticate and obtain a JWT token:

```
POST /api/auth/login
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "username": "your_username",
  "password": "your_password"
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9...",
  "username": "your_username"
}
```

### Using the JWT Token

Include the JWT token in the Authorization header for subsequent requests:

```
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9...
```

## Security Best Practices

1. **HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS in production to encrypt data in transit
2. **Token Storage**: Store JWT tokens securely on the client side (e.g., HttpOnly cookies)
3. **Token Expiration**: Use short-lived tokens and implement token refresh mechanisms
4. **Password Policies**: Enforce strong password policies (length, complexity, etc.)
5. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting on authentication endpoints to prevent brute force attacks

## Future Enhancements

1. Implement two-factor authentication (2FA) for sensitive operations
2. Add account lockout after multiple failed login attempts
3. Implement password strength validation
4. Add token revocation capabilities
5. Implement refresh token mechanism for improved security
